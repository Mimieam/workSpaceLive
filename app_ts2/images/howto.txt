Using Sketch...

get the font icon - download the demo and increase the font size as big as you want
take a screenshot of that big icon and put it into sketch
select the white background of the icon and delete it
then crop it to a square length - lock the width and height
shrink logo to 128 x 128

then export using the multipliers


0.125x   => 16 x 16
0.15x  => 19 x 19
0.3x  => 38 x 38
1x => 128 x 128


Or... group the logo / and click Scale [next to mask]
and just the new size there
